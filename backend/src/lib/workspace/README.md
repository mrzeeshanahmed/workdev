# backend/src/lib/workspace

Purpose: Small backend library module to contain workspace-related domain logic (models, services, helpers) for the Shared project workspace feature.

Planned contents:
- models (ProjectWorkspace, Milestone, Message, File)
- services (milestoneService, workspaceService, fileService)
- state transition helpers and audit logging utilities

Conventions:
- Keep implementation library-first and test-first per repository constitution.
