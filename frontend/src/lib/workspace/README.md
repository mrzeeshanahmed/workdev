# frontend/src/lib/workspace

Purpose: Small frontend component library to contain Workspace UI building blocks for the Shared project workspace feature.

Planned contents:
- Tabs and layout components for Workspace page
- Milestones components: list, item, submission modal, audit trail
- Messages and Files components used within the workspace

Conventions:
- Keep components small and well-typed; prefer composition over inheritance.
