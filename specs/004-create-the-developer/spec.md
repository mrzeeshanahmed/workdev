# Feature Specification: Developer Dashboard & Experience

**Feature Branch**: `004-create-the-developer`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create the developer dashboard and experience for WorkDev. The dashboard must feature a personalized project feed that intelligently surfaces relevant jobs to the developer. Implement saved searches and email notifications for new projects that match a developer's criteria. Create a streamlined proposal submission form and a proposal tracking page where developers can view the status of their active applications. Finally, include a private analytics section on the dashboard that shows the developer their profile views and proposal success rate."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts: developer dashboard, personalized project feed, saved searches, email notifications, proposal submission, proposal tracking, private analytics
3. Ambiguities:
   - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What criteria are available for saved searches?]
   - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How often are email notifications sent?]
   - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What data is shown in analytics (beyond profile views and proposal success rate)?]
   - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What statuses can a proposal have?]
   - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there limits on the number of saved searches?]
4. User Scenarios & Testing: see below
5. Functional Requirements: see below
6. Key Entities: see below
7. Review Checklist: see below
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer logs into WorkDev and lands on their dashboard. They see a personalized feed of projects relevant to their skills and interests. The developer saves a search for "React remote jobs" and opts in to receive email notifications for new matches. When a new project matching their criteria is posted, they receive an email. The developer submits a proposal using a streamlined form and later checks the proposal tracking page to see its status. They also review their analytics to see how many times their profile was viewed and their proposal success rate.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer with a completed profile, **When** they visit the dashboard, **Then** they see a personalized project feed.
2. **Given** a developer, **When** they create a saved search with specific criteria, **Then** the system stores the search and uses it for notifications.
3. **Given** a developer with saved searches, **When** a new project matches, **Then** the developer receives an email notification.
4. **Given** a developer, **When** they submit a proposal via the dashboard, **Then** the proposal is recorded and visible in their tracking page.
5. **Given** a developer with active proposals, **When** they visit the proposal tracking page, **Then** they see the status of each application.
6. **Given** a developer, **When** they visit the analytics section, **Then** they see their profile views and proposal success rate.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a developer has no relevant projects? [System should show an empty state or suggestions.]
- How does the system handle duplicate saved searches? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- What if email delivery fails? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How are proposal statuses updated (manual, automatic)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a personalized project feed for each developer based on their profile and activity.
- **FR-002**: Developers MUST be able to create, edit, and delete saved searches with custom criteria. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: criteria options]
- **FR-003**: System MUST send email notifications to developers when new projects match their saved searches. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification frequency]
- **FR-004**: Developers MUST be able to submit proposals via a streamlined form from the dashboard.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a proposal tracking page showing the status of all active applications. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: status types]
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a private analytics section with profile views and proposal success rate. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: analytics data granularity]
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle empty states gracefully (e.g., no projects, no proposals).
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent duplicate saved searches for the same criteria. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how to define duplicates]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle email delivery failures and notify the user. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification method]
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow developers to opt in/out of email notifications for each saved search.

### Key Entities
- **Developer**: Represents a user with a profile, skills, and preferences.
- **Project**: Represents a job or opportunity posted on WorkDev.
- **SavedSearch**: Stores a developer's search criteria and notification preferences.
- **Proposal**: Represents an application submitted by a developer for a project, with status and timestamps.
- **Analytics**: Aggregated data for a developer (profile views, proposal success rate, etc.).
