# Implementation Plan: Developer Dashboard

**Branch**: `004-create-the-developer` | **Date**: 2025-09-21 | **Spec**: /specs/004-create-the-developer/spec.md

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js 18+ (server-side)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Express, PostgreSQL (or Supabase), Vitest (tests)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL  
**Testing**: Vitest, supertest (integration)  
**Target Platform**: Web backend + optional frontend  
**Project Type**: web (backend + frontend)  

## Summary
Create a Developer Dashboard that surfaces profile analytics, proposals, saved searches and related APIs.

## Phase 0: Research
...completed (see research.md)

## Phase 1: Design
...completed (see data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)

## Phase 2: Task Planning
Completed: see `tasks.md` for ordered, TDD-first tasks.

## Phase 3: Implementation
Completed: minimal in-memory backend implemented for contract tests. Contract tests updated to use `supertest` and `createTestServer`.

## Phase 4: Validation
Completed: All contract, unit, and integration tests required by this feature currently pass in the in-memory test environment. Tests: 27 passed, 1 skipped (see quickstart.md for exact commands and sample output).

## Phase 5: Finalization
Completed: Plan updated and quickstart verified. Follow-ups: migrate in-memory store to a persistent DB (e.g., SQLite in-memory CI or PostgreSQL in staging), add observability export (file sink or remote provider) and add end-to-end smoke tests in CI.

## Summary of changes for this feature
- Implemented models (in-memory) and services for proposals and saved searches.
- Implemented developer dashboard endpoint and contract tests.
- Added structured logging and centralized error handler (T018).
- Updated quickstart and plan to reflect completed work and next steps.

## Follow-up tasks (post-merge)
- Migrate to persistent DB and add migrations.
- Add CI job to run contract tests against an ephemeral DB.
- Integrate logs with a file sink during development and with a remote provider in staging/prod.
