# Feature Specification: Shared project workspace - WorkDev

**Feature Branch**: `005-title-shared-project`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create the shared project workspace for WorkDev. This workspace should only be accessible to the client who owns the project and the developer who has been hired. The workspace must have a tabbed interface with sections for \"Milestones,\" \"Messages,\" \"Files,\" and \"Details.\" The core feature is the Milestones tab, which should allow for the creation, submission, and approval or revision of project milestones, with clear status tracking for each."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a client who hired a developer, I want a private shared project workspace where I and the hired developer can manage project milestones, exchange messages, upload and organize files, and view project details so that project work is coordinated, milestone deliverables are tracked, and approvals are recorded.

Actors:
- Client (project owner)
- Developer (hired contractor)

Primary goals:
- Create milestone items representing deliverables and due dates
- Developer can submit completed milestones for review
- Client can approve or request revision on submitted milestones
- Both parties can message each other and attach files to messages or milestones
- Files can be uploaded, organized, and versioned in the Files tab
- Details tab displays project metadata and permissions

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new project with a client and a hired developer assigned, **When** the client or developer opens the shared workspace, **Then** they see the tabbed interface with Milestones, Messages, Files, and Details and only the two authorized users have access.

2. **Given** the developer has completed work for a milestone, **When** the developer marks the milestone as "Submitted" and provides submission notes and attachments, **Then** the milestone status becomes "Submitted" and the client receives a notification and a clear view of submission details.

3. **Given** a milestone is in "Submitted" status, **When** the client clicks "Approve", **Then** the milestone status becomes "Approved", an approval record is created (timestamp + approver), and the developer is notified.

4. **Given** a milestone is in "Submitted" status, **When** the client clicks "Request Revision" and provides feedback, **Then** the milestone status becomes "Revision Requested", the developer is notified, and the milestone remains open until resubmitted.

5. **Given** either party uploads files within the Files tab or attaches files to a milestone or message, **When** a file is uploaded, **Then** the file metadata (uploader, timestamp, original filename, optional description) is recorded and the file is accessible to both users.

6. **Given** the developer or client posts a message, **When** the recipient opens Messages, **Then** messages are shown in chronological order with attachments rendered and a simple unread/read indicator.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the client removes the developer from the project while there are open milestones? (See [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected behavior when roles change ‚Äî reassign, archive, or lock?])
- How does the system behave if the client or developer is offline when a milestone is submitted? (Notifications should be queued/delivered when they return.)
- What is the expected file size limit and allowed file types for uploads? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How to handle conflicting simultaneous edits to milestone metadata (due date, attachments)? (Prefer last-write-wins or optimistic locking?) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Retention and deletion policy for files and messages (e.g., after project completion) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a private shared workspace per project accessible only to the client who owns the project and the single hired developer assigned to that project.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a tabbed interface with four primary tabs: Milestones, Messages, Files, and Details.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow creation of milestone items with at minimum: title, description, due date, amount/payment (if applicable), and attachments.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support milestone lifecycle states at minimum: Draft, Submitted, Revision Requested, Approved, Rejected, and Archived.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow the developer (or client) to save a milestone as Draft and later submit it for client review.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow the developer to submit a milestone for review; submission should capture submission notes, attachments, and timestamp.
- **FR-007**: System MUST notify the client when a milestone is submitted, and notify the developer when a milestone is approved or a revision is requested.
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow the client to Approve or Request Revision on a submitted milestone; the action must record approver, timestamp, and any feedback text.
- **FR-009**: System MUST present an audit trail for each milestone showing state changes, who performed each transition, timestamps, and any associated notes/attachments.
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow files to be uploaded and associated with milestones, messages, or stored in Files tab; basic metadata must be recorded (uploader, time, filename, size).
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a Messages tab supporting threaded conversation between the two participants with optional file attachments and read/unread indicators.
- **FR-012**: System MUST include a Details tab showing project metadata: project title, description, participants, start/end dates, payment terms, and permissions.
- **FR-013**: System MUST enforce access control so only the client and the hired developer have access to the workspace and its content.
- **FR-014**: System SHOULD allow the client to reassign or remove the developer (mark as optional - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact desired behavior on reassignment]).
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow export or snapshot of milestone states and attachments for record-keeping (format to be determined) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: preferred export format].

*Non-functional requirements (high level)*
- **NFR-001**: The workspace UI MUST be responsive and accessible on desktop and mobile widths.
- **NFR-002**: Notifications for milestone events MUST be delivered within a reasonable time (near real-time where possible) and be retryable if delivery fails.
- **NFR-003**: File uploads MUST be stored reliably with integrity checks; the system MUST prevent common file-attack vectors (validate file types at upload) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: allowed types].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ProjectWorkspace**: represents the private workspace for a project. Attributes: projectId, clientId, developerId, workspaceStatus, createdAt, updatedAt.
- **Milestone**: represents a milestone. Attributes: milestoneId, projectId, title, description, dueDate, amount, state (Draft|Submitted|Revision Requested|Approved|Rejected|Archived), attachments[], createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt, history[] (state transitions).
- **Message**: represents a message between participants. Attributes: messageId, projectId, senderId, recipientId(s), body, attachments[], createdAt, readAt.
- **File**: represents uploaded file metadata. Attributes: fileId, projectId, uploaderId, filename, size, mimeType, storagePath, uploadedAt, version.

## Notes and Assumptions
- Assumption: Workspace access is limited to the client and exactly one hired developer per project. If multiple developers are expected, this needs clarification.
- Assumption: Payments and escrow flows are out of scope for the initial milestone lifecycle unless explicitly requested.
- Security, retention, and file-type policies need to be clarified before implementation.
